# Crypto Fund Withholding
The current nature of Crypto transation has been non-revertable. It's a challenge for use cases that need the fund to be withhold for a period of time before release it to the other party or have the ability to cancel the transaction if certain conditiaons don't meet. 

## Use case 
1. Withhold: this is used to hold certain amount of money so that some transaction can be executed later. 

2. For merchandise purchase, we can hold the fund before the buyer recieves the merchandise. This protected the seller for the risk of not getting the payment and the buyer for not recieve the goods. 

3. For donation management, we can hold the fund in the contract. The distribution of fund to recievers will be managed by the contractor. 

## Test
run `truffle test` with ganche-cli on port 8545
